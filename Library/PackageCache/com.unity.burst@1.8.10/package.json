    "changelog": "### Fixed\n- Fixed the Burst Inspector not displaying target methods if namespace/class contained the method name.\n- Linking libstdc++/libc++ statically on HMI platforms\n- Fixed an issue that caused an empty variable to be returned if it is between a zero initializer\n- Native debug information would fail to reflect the contents of parameters to functions.\n- For native debug information, type symbols can now be referenced using :: separator between namespaces (C++ style) - E.g. Example.Type  becomes Example::Type.\n- Fixed that changing certain player build platform settings (like SDK version) would not trigger Burst to recompile\n- Fixed invalid burst string formats leading to internal compiler error.\n- Fixed QNX player builds on 32-bit ARM\n- Fixed an error thrown by the Burst Inspector when opening a non-static job with special characters in its name\n\n### Added\n- Added support for System.Math functions Acosh, Asinh, Atanh, Cbrt, CopySign, Log2, SinCos, FusedMultiplyAdd, and ILogB\n\n### Removed\n- Remove all code specific to DOTS Runtime\n\n### Changed\n- Use mimalloc as our native allocator on Windows to speed up concurrently executing LLVM work\n\n### Known Issues"
